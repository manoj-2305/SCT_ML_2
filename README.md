## Overview

SCT_ML_2 is designed to facilitate machine learning workflows, including data analysis, model development, and experimentation. It provides a collection of notebooks that cover different ML algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics.

## Features

- Interactive Jupyter Notebooks for ML experiments
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation of popular machine learning algorithms
- Evaluation and comparison of models
- Modular Python scripts for utility functions

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manoj-2305/SCT_ML_2.git
cd SCT_ML_2
```

Recommended: Use a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:**  
> Most projects are implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Make sure you have Jupyter installed:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the desired notebook (`.ipynb`) and follow the instructions within each cell.

3. For Python scripts, execute them as needed:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
